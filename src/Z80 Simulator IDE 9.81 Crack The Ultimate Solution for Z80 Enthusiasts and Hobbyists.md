If you want to start using Z80 Simulator IDE 9.81, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install the software from the official website. You can choose between the 32-bit and the 64-bit version depending on your system.
2. Run the software and choose the project type. You can create a new project or open an existing one. You can also import a project from TASM Z80 assembler.
3. Write your code in the assembler editor or the basic editor. You can use the interactive assembler editor if you are a beginner or the advanced assembler editor if you are more experienced. You can also use the basic compiler to write your code in Z80 basic language.
4. Compile your code and check for errors. You can use the compile button or the F9 key to compile your code. The compiler will show you any errors or warnings in your code and highlight them in the editor.
5. Run your code in the simulator and see the results. You can use the run button or the F5 key to run your code. The simulator will show you the internal processor architecture, the memory editors, the video memory screen, the input/output terminals, and the peripheral devices interface. You can also see the simulation statistics and log in the log viewer.
6. Debug your code if needed. You can use the debugger to set breakpoints, step through your code, watch variables, modify registers and memory, etc. You can use the debug button or the F8 key to enter the debug mode. The debugger will show you the breakpoints manager, the code execution tracking feature, and the disassembler.

Z80 Simulator IDE 9.81 is a comprehensive and user-friendly software that can help you develop Z80 programs with ease and fun. It has many features and options that can suit your needs and preferences. It is also compatible with TASM Z80 assembler and external simulation modules. You can use it for educational or personal purposes, as long as you respect the license terms and conditions.
